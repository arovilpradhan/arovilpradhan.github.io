                     My IT journey began in college when I learned fundamentals of Hardware & Networking, Linux, CCNA, and MCSA under a mentor. I later joined his small computer sales and services venture to gain real-world experience, supporting local offices, banks, and homes with system setups and IT troubleshooting. With 6+ years in IT infrastructure and support, I’m now transitioning into cybersecurity — focusing on Blue Team roles like SOC Analyst and Cybersecurity Analyst. My goal is to build expertise in enterprise defense operations such as threat detection, log analysis, and vulnerability management, eventually progressing toward offensive security and ethical hacking.

                    <p class="lead justify-text">
                     I’m actively upskilling through Fortinet’s FCF program, ISC2 CC, and TryHackMe’s Cybersecurity 101 & SOC Level 1 paths (handle: GhostWarrior). I prefer hands-on learning through labs and real-world simulations, and I’ve built Python scripts to automate tasks like IP status updates and Site24x7 monitor deletions, which were later integrated into Flask APIs. ools I’ve worked with include Qualys VMDR (scanner-level), Site24x7, and SolarWinds IPAM & Web Help Desk. I’ve also supported MFA setups for RSA, Duo, and Okta (end-user level). My certifications include Microsoft AZ-900, ITIL-4, ISC2 CC, and multiple Qualys certs (VMDR, QQL, Admin). I aim to leverage my infrastructure background to grow in cybersecurity and contribute effectively to Blue Team operations.

        <p class="justify-text">
          In my current role, I support core infrastructure projects with a focus on enterprise monitoring and vulnerability management. I manage Qualys VMDR dashboards (scanner-level access) to monitor vulnerabilities across assigned assets and coordinate with the security team when escalated access or configuration support is needed. Twice a month, I generate and share vulnerability reports — one in the first week and another at month-end — for the Windows, Linux, and VMware teams to initiate patching. While patching is handled by senior team members, I track progress, validate fixes, and ensure remediation is reflected in updated reports. Additionally, I use Site24x7 for real-time infrastructure monitoring and have developed Python scripts to automate tasks like monitor deletions and SolarWinds IP status updates. These scripts are integrated with ServiceNow via REST APIs in collaboration with senior engineers, contributing to a more streamlined monitoring and reporting workflow.

        <div class="subheading mb-2">Hitachi Vantara India Pvt Ltd, Pune</div>
        <p class="justify-text">
          In my previous role at Hitachi Vantara, I provided L1–L3 IT support to internal users through ServiceNow, using remote tools like Bomgar, MS Teams, and phone, while also offering onsite assistance when needed to ensure SLA compliance. I managed laptop and accessory inventory with complete accuracy, coordinated vendor service requests, and supported both routine and yearly IT hardware audits for the Pune site. I handled secure user onboarding and offboarding, provisioning assets, ensuring security compliance, and coordinating asset recovery. I collaborated with cross-functional teams—including Network, Infrastructure, and Engineering—to troubleshoot and escalate critical issues, and actively participated in scheduled IT maintenance windows. My responsibilities also included reviewing vulnerability reports in Qualys (read-only access), remediating flagged devices through software removal or OS reinstallation, validating fixes, and reporting them for compliance closure. I supported AV and video conferencing setups across locations, handled warranty cases for Lenovo and Apple devices, contributed to IT outage resolution, and conducted internal knowledge-sharing sessions to upskill IT and cross-functional teams.
          <p class="justify-text">During my early days at Hitachi Vantara, I was involved in resolving a global IT outage caused by a misconfiguration in the Carbon Black endpoint security tool, which blocked many users worldwide from logging into their systems. With limited guidance and mounting pressure, I devised a manual recovery method by leveraging BitLocker recovery in Windows recovery mode. This involved gaining administrative command-line access by replacing sethc.exe with cmd.exe, resetting the local admin account password, and disabling Carbon Black services through the registry. I successfully used this method to recover several user machines, and my approach was immediately shared by my manager on a company-wide desktop operations call across multiple sites. A few days later, I learned that my workaround was later scripted and deployed enterprise-wide by the desktop engineering and security teams to automate the recovery process. Contributing to a live enterprise incident at such an early stage helped sharpen my problem-solving mindset and reinforced the importance of creative thinking in high-pressure situations.</p>

        <p class="justify-text">
          In my previous role at Schneider Electric (via Vision India Services Pvt Ltd), I deployed Windows 10 systems for the R&D lab using WDS over LAN through PXE boot. While I did not manage the WDS server directly, I have knowledge in its configuration and understand how it operates within an enterprise imaging environment. I independently set up and managed a Kali Linux VM running OpenVAS for internal vulnerability scans, and also worked with Nessus (with limited access, managed by the senior network lead) to identify and report vulnerabilities. Remediation involved coordinating patching, disabling misconfigured services, and validating fixes across R&D systems. I used PowerShell scripts (developed by my manager) to detect weak passwords, unauthorized admin accounts, and open SMB shares, reviewing the output and supporting remediation actions.
          I also performed basic user and group administration using Active Directory and handled onboarding/offboarding, including account setup, access provisioning, and hardware allocation. Additionally, I maintained a separate asset sheet for tracking R&D equipment frequently received at the Hyderabad site. Upon delivery, I logged and labeled each item before transferring them to respective teams, ensuring proper documentation and control prior to lab usage. I resolved L1/L2 tickets via the internal helpdesk portal, maintained IT inventory for compliance tracking, supported Windows/Linux system setups for development teams, and assisted with local data center maintenance and secure access handling. I managed AV setups for video conferencing systems and coordinated with vendors for hardware upgrades and repairs.

My responsibilities included supporting secure connectivity solutions such as Cisco AnyConnect, DUO VPN, and RSA SecurID, helping to ensure secure access for remote employees. I also diagnosed and configured softphones like Genesys and Avaya, and provided basic troubleshooting for VoIP hardware. In virtualized environments, I supported VDI platforms including Dizzion and VMware Horizon, assisting with session resets and access-related issues. Additionally, I managed Active Directory user accounts — handling password resets, group assignments, and access troubleshooting — while enforcing access control policies. I also offered guidance for desktop hardware and software issues, contributing to improved endpoint reliability and end-user productivity.
